# .ui to .py-converter
GUI for converting .ui files to .py 

pyuic5.exe needs to be in the same folder as main.py. 

How it works:
1. Locate your ui file that you want to convert.
2. Select the location that you want the .py file to be saved.
3. Press convert

# TODO:
Currently this program has almost no error handling. So next thing to do is add some.
